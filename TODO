Example:
  - Always link to code
  - Start with raw website, bad design, then add design gradually
  - app router example
  - app router + swr
  - server action (+ swr?)
  - middleware example + show code. usecase?
  - pages example + show code. usecase?
  - getServerSideProps (legacy)
  - read Next.js doc to find cases

To answer:
- Why are iron-webcrypto and others parts of dev dependencies, are we building even for node?
- Are we testing in different Node.js versions? Next.js versions?

Test website must include, in a very clear way:
  ☐ Route handler examples (app router). Serverless and edge.
  ☐ Server actions. (can it be serverless and edge?)
  ☐ API routes examples (pages, legacy). Serverless and edge.
  ☐ getServerSideProps examples (pages, legacy). Serverless and edge.

☐ Test bun when the package is released in beta
☐ Test deno when the package is released in beta

Answered:
- Are we using workspaces?
  Yes
