Examples:
  ✔ app router + client component + route handlers + redirects + fetch @done(23-11-16 00:05)
  ✔ app router + server component + server action (the good stuff from lee, first example) @done(23-11-16 13:50)
  ☐ app router + server action + route handlers + fetch + revalidate (same as previous but use fetch and revalidate)
  ☐ pages + redirects + fetch
  ☐ pages + swr
  ☐ pages + getServerSideProps
  ☐ app router + client component + route handlers + swr (no redirect)
  ☐ edit in codesandbox link
  ☐ deploy to vercel link
  ☐ +edge
  ☐ +skeletons

Example:
  - Always link to code
  - Start with raw website, bad design, then add design gradually
  - app router example
  - app router + swr
  - server action (+ swr?)
  - middleware example + show code. usecase?
  - pages example + show code. usecase?
  - getServerSideProps (legacy)
  - read Next.js doc to find cases
  - disable JavaScript, what happens?

To answer:
- Why are iron-webcrypto and others parts of dev dependencies, are we building even for node?
- Are we testing in different Node.js versions? Next.js versions?

Test website must include, in a very clear way:
  ☐ Route handler examples (app router). Serverless and edge.
  ☐ Server actions. (can it be serverless and edge?)
  ☐ API routes examples (pages, legacy). Serverless and edge.
  ☐ getServerSideProps examples (pages, legacy). Serverless and edge.

☐ Test bun when the package is released in beta
☐ Test deno when the package is released in beta

Answered:
- Are we using workspaces?
  Yes
