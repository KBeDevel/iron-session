    ✔ what are mergeHeaders, createResponse?? why do we need them here? @done(23-11-20 00:09)
    ✔ why do we need OverridableOptions?? @done(23-11-20 00:09)
  ✔ Add blurb about the technique, as previously done @done(23-11-20 00:09)
  ☐ Check Notion page
  ☐ Make preview deployment working

  ☐ add protected page link anyone can access (+ redirect to login, perhaps use server components for this)
    ☐ add middleware example to check for protected pages
  ☐ change all calls to /session only
  ☐ optimistic updates in all examples if feasible easily
  ☐ add prefetch when possible
    ☐ add prefetch where relevant https://swr.vercel.app/docs/prefetching (index page)
  ☐ add example with magic link (+ explain where it can be used)

  ☐ app router + server component where relevant + client components where relevant (check partial prerendering)
  ☐ app router + client component + server action and optimistic updates https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/forms-and-mutations#optimistic-updates
  ☐ add text below each example to show what's slow to load
  ☐ change all calls to POST DELETE /session (no more /login)
  ☐ provide a way to set default session data and update all examples with it
  ☐ ask community to complete other examples

  ☐ optimistic updates in general in the various examples, how?
  ☐ pages + redirects + fetch
  ☐ pages + swr
  ☐ pages + getServerSideProps
  ☐ app router + client component + route handlers + swr (no redirect)
  ☐ edit in codesandbox link
  ☐ deploy to vercel link
  ☐ +edge
  ☐ +skeletons
  ☐ +link to gh
  ☐ +pages examples to be done by community/later

Example:
  - Always link to code
  - Start with raw website, bad design, then add design gradually
  - app router example
  - app router + swr
  - server action (+ swr?)
  - middleware example + show code. usecase?
  - pages example + show code. usecase?
  - getServerSideProps (legacy)
  - read Next.js doc to find cases
  - disable JavaScript, what happens?

To answer:
- Why are iron-webcrypto and others parts of dev dependencies, are we building even for node?
- Are we testing in different Node.js versions? Next.js versions?

Test website must include, in a very clear way:
  ☐ Route handler examples (app router). Serverless and edge.
  ☐ Server actions. (can it be serverless and edge?)
  ☐ API routes examples (pages, legacy). Serverless and edge.
  ☐ getServerSideProps examples (pages, legacy). Serverless and edge.

☐ Test bun when the package is released in beta
☐ Test deno when the package is released in beta

Answered:
- Are we using workspaces?
  Yes
